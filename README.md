# formplugin
wordpress form for user signup/login/profile pages
User submission form is a simple and easy to use plugin for wordpress
After activateing the plugin it will create an admin menu in wp_admin/
you can set the specific page for the page to show and specific message on login/sigup success/failure message 
I uses ajax and jquery for validation.
